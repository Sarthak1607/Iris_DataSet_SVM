# Iris_DataSet_SVM

The data set consists of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). 
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
SVM is a powerful and flexible class of supervised algorithms for both classification and regression. Support Vectors are the simple co-oridnates of individual obeservation.
Support Vecrtor Machine(SVM) is a borderline/boundary/limit which segregates the features.
